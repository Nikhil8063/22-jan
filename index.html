           number of universities and colleges that had created distance education
            courses or programs. Dixon (1996) had compiled a guide for students that
            includes chapters on quality in distance education and what to expect in a
            virtual classroom. Porter (1997) had endeavored to give practical advice on
            putting together effective programs and courses, including a checklist for
            course design and evaluation. All of these books were useful but only barely
            prepared CECC for issues, challenges, problems and confrontations to come.<br>
             &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In retrospect, CECC’s lack of knowledge of the potential difficulties
            might have been a good thing, because the management team proceeded
            without fear of the difficulties ahead.<br>
             &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CECC staff didn’t plan for every contingency and consequently develop-ment was not stalled. The CECC staff plugged along, without complete
            awareness of the difficulties of trying to merge the instructional and student
            services policies of 14 colleges. CECC didn’t even know how to go about
            improving its awareness and how to best work with the colleges. Every
            activity the CECC management team undertook to educate these colleges
            about the workings of the centralized management team and the program
            policies and procedures became an activity that educated the management
            team. CECC soon recognized that each college, while part of the same system,
            still had individual policies and processes that had to be taken into account.<br>
             &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over time, intra and intercollegiate teams and committees have been
            created to facilitate governance and management of the program and to
            deliver high-quality instructional and student services. These committees and
            teams allow all the member colleges to have a voice in guiding program
            management and the future direction. The committees and teams strive to be
            inclusive and often call upon subject matter experts from other parts of the
            college(s) to solve problems or create new online educational approaches.
            These teams and committees act as connecting agents back to their college
            constituents and improve information flow between the constituents and the
            management team.<br>

        <h2>A CASE STUDY IN MANAGING A DISTANCE
            EDUCATION CONSORTIUM</h2>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CCCOnline is a unique consortial approach to distance education created
            in September 1997 by the Community Colleges of Colorado (hereinafter
            referred to as “CC of C”). CC of C oversees 13 NCA-accredited Colorado
            community colleges and one nonaccredited community college called Colo-rado Electronic Community College (CECC). Together, these colleges serve
            almost 250,000 Colorado students annually.
         <br>
        <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fall of 1997, the CC of C System president convened a meeting of
            the 14 community college presidents. He proposed the creation of an online
            degree and certificate program that would be developed and delivered
            consortially. The colleges would share the development costs equally but
            would receive revenue based upon their individual college enrollments. A
            contract was negotiated with a for-profit vendor to provide the course
            management software and support on its computer servers. The vendor’s
            initial $100,000 development charge (not including faculty costs) was di-vided equally among the colleges.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CECC was selected to provide leadership and management support for
            the new online program. Since 1995, CECC had managed an Associate of
            Arts telecourse degree program that linked an accredited CC of C college with
            an outside vendor. The accredited CC of C college provided the financial aid
            and transcripted the credit, and the vendor provided national marketing, a call
            center, and bookstore/videotape delivery services. CECC hired faculty,
            provided the instructional materials, advising and registration services, and
            managed the relationships with the vendor and the accredited CC of C college.
            So CECC was a logical choice to lead the new consortium because of its
            previous experience managing college/for-profit partnerships. Also, because
            CECC was not accredited and did not enroll students, the member colleges
            considered it noncompetitive.<br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name chosen for the new online consortial model was CCCOnline.
            The first degree CCCOnline offered was an Associate of Applied Science in
            Business. Many of CC of C colleges already had their own versions of this
            degree, and it was a popular degree. So it was a generally held belief that this
            degree would generate high enrollments. Still in the early days of the
            development of CCCOnline, two main challenges were identified:<br>
            1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creating a degree with a consistent list of course offerings and
            requirements on which colleges could mutually agree. All of the
            colleges offered all of the courses that would be part of the online
            Associate of Applied Science in Business. However, for some col-leges the new online degree required giving up one or two courses
            from their current business degrees. For other colleges, the new
            online degree obligated them to accept new courses that were not
            required in their current business degrees.<br>
            2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creating an equitable financial model. From the beginning, CECC,
            managing CCCOnline on behalf of the consortium, was intended to be
            mainly self-supporting. The model had to allow for a management fee to
            support CECC and create enough new state general fund support and
            tuition funds for member colleges.
        <br><br>
             &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CECC management team put in long, intense days during the first
            two months of operation. The management team strived to meet the goals of
            the program and simultaneously respond to implementation challenges.<br>
            There were two program goals:<br>
            1.&nbsp;&nbsp; To eliminate redundancy of online offerings.<br>
            2.&nbsp;&nbsp; To expand educational offerings to rural students.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many community colleges, especially in the Denver metropolitan area,
            were already offering online courses. In the year prior to the creation of
            CCCOnline, these colleges became aware that they could no longer control
            a service area marked by geographic boundaries. Therefore, these colleges
            could not depend on students residing in the college service areas to continue
            to fulfill their educational requirements at the local community college. Also,
            the colleges duplicated other colleges’ online course offerings, and CC of C
            believed that this duplication was an inefficient use of the hardware, software,
            personnel, and financial resources of the individual colleges.<br>
             &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, students in rural Colorado were faced with a limited
            number of choices when it came to community college courses and programs.
            Due to demands and economies of scale, many classes that could be offered
            in heavily populated urban areas could not be offered in the rural areas. Also,
            it was often difficult in rural areas to find faculty with subject matter expertise
            needed to teach certain classes.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the start-up days of CCCOnline, CECC remained the focal point
            for all communications regarding instructional, administrative, and student
            services issues. Communications between CECC staff and college staff were
            extensive. Misunderstandings were abundant, and even when policies and
            procedures were clarified, it wasn’t always clear who should receive the
            clarifications and whether the information would be widely disseminated.
            However, the CECC management team remained focused on working with
            the college partners to provide high-quality instruction and student services,
            and to eliminate barriers to online teaching and learning. Ad hoc teams of
            interested individuals were created to deal with immediate and obvious
            issues. These teams are defined the next section.
        <br><br>
        <h2>AD HOC TEAMS</h2>
        <h3>  The College Teams</h3> 
            &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite resistance from many of the local community colleges and
            limited policies and procedures, the first degree was online within 100 days
            of the creation of CCCOnline. A number of member colleges provided faculty
       
            to develop the initial 20 classes. Colleges that volunteered the initial faculty
            did so at their own expense, either paying the faculty overload fees or
            providing paid release time. The college presidents agreed that once the first
            degree was developed, all the colleges enrolling students in CCCOnline
            courses would jointly absorb future course development costs. Even those
            colleges where resistance to the consortial model was the highest were
            anxious to be contributors for fear that they might be left out of a potentially
            successful program.<br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New policies and procedures written in early days were designed to
            address student services issues. Member college registrars met to discuss
            student record processes: 1) how the courses would be entered into their
            databases, 2) how to distinguish these courses from other campus offerings,
            3) how and when to create semesters and sessions; and, 4) what semester and
            session start and stop dates would be.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other ad hoc student services teams were created as required. These
            teams met to discuss how to deliver online advising, provide financial aid
            services online, and develop a common online application form. While CECC
            gradually realized that long-term committees and new ways of communicating would have to be established after the program was built, its initial,
            primary goal was to get its CCCOnline up and running.
        <br><br>
        <h3>The Course Management Provider Team</h3>
           &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using an outside vendor with its own hardware, software, and personnel resources allowed the instructors to focus on the development of high-quality course materials. The local vendor, eCollege.com, provided the
            course management software and was initially chosen because it could
            provide an application and registration software in addition to the course
            management software. The existing Student Information System (SIS),
            registration software used by the community colleges, did not allow for
            online registration. We strove to create a one-stop online site for students,
            regardless of the college that would grant the credit. The vendor provided
            the online application and registration software. Students could visit the
            central website, choose a “home” college from among the consortial
            members, apply, and enroll. Once classes began, students could access the
            same online site to receive their instruction. For these services, the vendor
            charged a onetime, up-front, development fee for each course created on
            its system. The vendor also charged a per-student enrollment fee that
            would be computed and billed the day after the last date to drop in any
        <br>
            given session (14 days after the course start date).<br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enrollment data collected by the vendor’s software was uploaded to
            the member colleges’ computerized SIS every night. It helped that every
            college in the consortium used the same SIS; only one program had to be
            written to update the records of the consortial member colleges.
        <br><br>
        <h3>The Centralized Computer Services Team</h3>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CC of C centrally maintains the SIS for the member colleges. Staff from
            the CC of C's Computer Department worked very closely with the vendor’s
            technical staff. Together, they formed a team that wrote the program that
            would upload and download data between CC of C computers and vendor
            computers. the CC of C's Computer Department also wrote programs that
            would search college SIS databases and remove the duplicate records that
            were sure to be created. Duplication was inevitable because all students, even
            those currently enrolled in traditional courses at member colleges, were
            required to reapply the first time they elected to take CCCOnline courses. This
            was necessary so that the vendor could establish a student database and build
            course rosters. Additionally, the CC of C's Computer Department met with
            the registrars and CECC staff and created procedures to assure that online
            courses were included in each college’s database.<br>
             &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 1998, CCCOnline began offering the Associate of Applied
            Science in Business degree. The first semester, slightly less than 300 students
            enrolled in CCCOnline courses. CECC considered this a great start consid-ering that very little advertising and virtually no up-front marketing had been
            done. From the onset, it was clear that there was a market for this type of
            educational offering and that the program was destined to grow.
        <br><br>
        <h2>A SAMPLING OF PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED</h2>
             &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During CCCOnline’s first two months of online operation, a majority of
            the problems related to instructional content. However, towards the last week
            of the first semester, a host of issues surfaced. Student services, instructional
            services, and business services departments across the consortium began
            identifying issues needing resolution. Some of the more gripping issues the
            consortium faced are described below.<br>
        <br>
          <h3>Student Services Issues</h3>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the short time of “program creation to market delivery,” little
            thought was given to the way that student services would be handled at the
